                    Samantha in 2018
                    Although Samantha often portrayed strong character roles in her early films, post-2012, she has appeared increasingly in big-budget, hero-oriented films, which have comparatively smaller scope for actresses.[53] Samantha next appeared in the Telugu multi-starrer film, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) alongside Venkatesh and Mahesh Babu, which received positive reviews and was commercially successful. Though her role was comparatively minuscule to her co-stars, IBN Live noted it was "good to see Samantha shed her glamorous side and welcome performance-oriented roles, which she only handles with deftness and ease".[54][55] The romantic comedy Jabardasth (2013) alongside Siddharth, in which she portrayed a wedding planner, became a commercial failure, though critics noted Samantha is "getting better by the day and it's a delight to watch her on screen".[56][57] Samantha then starred alongside Pawan Kalyan in the family drama, Attarintiki Daredi (2013), which emerged as the highest-grossing Telugu film upon release.

Samantha subsequently started the Pratyusha Support Foundation to provide medical support for women and children with the help of three doctor friends. She provided full financial support for the program.[138] She held a fundraiser in August 2013 to raise awareness of her foundation, auctioning several of her items and memorabilia from films.[139] A further initiative in 2014 saw the launch of a program to fulfill the wishes of children with life-threatening diseases; Samantha financed trips for children to fly on an airplane and travel to the Taj Mahal, and organized opportunities for children to meet their favorite film actors.[140][141] Samantha has also been involved in spreading awareness of haemophilia, regularly taking part in events creating awareness of the disease.[142]

                        Samantha agreed in January 2015 to pay a third of the hospital bills of one infant per week who required intensive care support at Andhra Hospitals through her charitable trust. Under the arrangement, Samantha agreed to contribute towards a third of the bills, while Andhra Hospitals would also pay a third of the bill, and the parents would pay the remaining third.[143] In November 2015, Samantha entered into a further agreement with Andhra Hospitals to sponsor vaccination of all infants below six months for rotaviral infections free of cost.[143][144] Later in the month, the actress took part in an organ donation pledge at Madhapur.[145] During the 2015 Chennai floods, Samantha was situated in Hyderabad for the shoot of a film and helped mobilize the Mana Madras Kosam initiative organized by the Telugu film industry.

                        <p5>The year 2014 saw Samantha appear in six films and make a return to the Tamil film industry. Her first release saw Samantha portray a dual role in the family drama film Manam (2014), where she featured alongside several members of the Akkineni film family. Featuring as a young mother and a college student in two different time eras, Samantha received positive reviews for her work, with the critic from Sify saying "she excels" and The Hindu's reviewer noting that she "emotes well and easily shifts between the roles."[60][61] Her performance fetched Samantha her fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu, while she won Best Actress (Critics) at the SIIMA Awards. Samantha subsequently featured alongside Naga Chaitanya again in the long-delayed Autonagar Surya (2014), before playing different minuscule roles in the Telugu action masala films Alludu Seenu (2014) and Rabhasa (2014). Critics lamented that she "signed up to be a glam doll" for the ventures. She has "previously shown us she is capable of doing much more, but of late, seems to be stuck with doing similar roles that require her to be an attractive prop."[62][63] Samantha later revealed that she solely worked on Alludu Seenu as a favor to producer Bellamkonda Suresh, who had helped her delay the making of Jabardasth during her health problems.[64]</p5>
